# ReadMe: Azimuth Cell Annotation and Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on annotating 10X snRNA-seq data of the human kidney using Azimuth, an R-based cell annotation tool, and visualizing the distribution of cell types in Python.

## Steps Taken to Solve the Problem

### 1. Setting Up the Environment
- Installed necessary R libraries, including Seurat and Azimuth, using the **LibraryInstallation.R** script.
- Installed necessary Python dependencies such as `anndata`, `requests`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `pandas` for handling and visualizing data.

### 2. Running Azimuth Annotation
- Loaded the **expr.h5ad** dataset in R.
- Used `RunAzimuth()` with the `kidneyref` reference dataset from SeuratData for annotation.
- Exported the annotated metadata as a CSV file (`annotated_expr.csv`).

### 3. Analyzing and Visualizing the Data in Python
- Loaded the CSV metadata file in Python using Pandas.
- Displayed the cell type distribution using `value_counts()`.
- Visualized the distribution using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** bar plots.

### 4. Extracting Insights
- Identified that **Principal cells** were the most abundant (5199 occurrences).
- Observed a steep decline in frequency for other cell types.
- Found that **Immune, Vascular Smooth Muscle/Pericyte, and Thick Ascending Limb cells** were extremely rare.

## Issues Encountered
1. **Azimuth Installation Problems**
   - The command `devtools::install_github("satijalab/seurat-data", "seurat5")` did not work despite installing `devtools`.
   - Attempted to use Docker with a Python image but faced additional issues.
   - Resolved the issue by following installation steps shared by user **pariapooyan** on [Biostars](https://www.biostars.org/p/9590021/).

2. **Reference Data Issues**
   - Initially downloaded human kidney reference data from **Zenodo**, but later switched to using **SeuratDataâ€™s kidney dataset**, which was more compatible.

3. **Exporting h5ad Format**
   - Directly exporting an **h5ad** file from R was complex.
   - Instead, exported annotation metadata as **CSV**, making it easier to analyze using **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** in Python.
